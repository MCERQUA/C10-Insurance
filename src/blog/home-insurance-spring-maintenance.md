Spring is the perfect time to inspect and maintain your home. Not only does regular maintenance prevent costly repairs, but it can also help you avoid insurance claims and potentially qualify for lower premiums. Here's your comprehensive spring maintenance checklist.

## Exterior Maintenance

- **Seal cracks** in foundation walls and walkways
- **Test sump pump** if you have one
- **Clear window wells** of debris

### Siding and Windows

- **Inspect and clean window wells**

## Interior Maintenance
